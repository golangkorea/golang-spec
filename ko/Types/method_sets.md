# [Method sets](#method-sets)

A type may have a *method set* associated with it. The method set of an [interface type](/Types/interface_types.html) is its interface. The method set of any other type `T` consists of all [methods](/Declarations%20and%20scope/method_declarations.html) declared with receiver type `T`. The method set of the corresponding [pointer type](/Types/pointer_types.html) `*T` is the set of all methods declared with receiver `*T` or `T` (that is, it also contains the method set of `T`). Further rules apply to structs containing embedded fields, as described in the section on [struct types](/Types/struct_types.html). Any other type has an empty method set. In a method set, each method must have a [unique](/Declarations%20and%20scope/uniqueness_of_identifiers.html) non-[blank](/Declarations%20and%20scope/blank_identifier.html) [method name](/Types/interface_types.html#MethodName).

The method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type [implements](/Types/interface_types.html) and the methods that can be [called](/Expressions/calls.html) using a receiver of that type.
