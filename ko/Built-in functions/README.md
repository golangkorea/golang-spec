# [Built-in functions](#built-in-functions)

Built-in functions are [predeclared](/Declarations%20and%20scope/predeclared_identifiers.html). They are called like any other function but some of them accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.

The built-in functions do not have standard Go types, so they can only appear in [call expressions](/Expressions/calls.html); they cannot be used as function values.
