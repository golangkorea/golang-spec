# Handling panics

Two built-in functions, `panic` and `recover`, assist in reporting and handling [run-time panics](/Run-time panics/) and program-defined error conditions.

func panic(interface{})
func recover() interface{}
While executing a function F, an explicit call to panic or a [run-time panic](/Run-time panics/) terminates the execution of F. Any functions [deferred](/Statements/defer_statements.html) by F are then executed as usual. Next, any deferred functions run by F's caller are run, and so on up to any deferred by the top-level function in the executing goroutine. At that point, the program is terminated and the error condition is reported, including the value of the argument to `panic`. This termination sequence is called *panicking*.

```
panic(42)
panic("unreachable")
panic(Error("cannot parse"))
```

The recover function allows a program to manage behavior of a panicking goroutine. Suppose a function G defers a function D that calls recover and a panic occurs in a function on the same goroutine in which G is executing. When the running of deferred functions reaches D, the return value of D's call to recover will be the value passed to the call of panic. If D returns normally, without starting a new panic, the panicking sequence stops. In that case, the state of functions called between G and the call to panic is discarded, and normal execution resumes. Any functions deferred by G before D are then run and G's execution terminates by returning to its caller.

The return value of recover is nil if any of the following conditions holds:
  * panic's argument was nil;
  * the goroutine is not panicking;
  * recover was not called directly by a deferred function.

The protect function in the example below invokes the function argument g and protects callers from run-time panics raised by g.

```
func protect(g func()) {
	defer func() {
		log.Println("done")  // Println executes normally even if there is a panic
		if x := recover(); x != nil {
			log.Printf("run time panic: %v", x)
		}
	}()
	log.Println("start")
	g()
}
```
