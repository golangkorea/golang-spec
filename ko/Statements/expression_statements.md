# Expression statements

With the exception of specific built-in functions, function and method [calls](/Expressions/calls.html) and [receive operations](/Expressions/receive_operator.html) can appear in statement context. Such statements may be parenthesized.

<pre>
<a id="ExpressionStmt">ExpressionStmt</a> = <a href="/Expressions/operators.html#Expression">Expression</a> .
</pre>

The following built-in functions are not permitted in statement context:

```
append cap complex imag len make new real
unsafe.Alignof unsafe.Offsetof unsafe.Sizeof
```

```
h(x+y)
f.Close()
<-ch
(<-ch)
len("foo")  // illegal if len is the built-in function
```
