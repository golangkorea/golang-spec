# Uniqueness of identifiers

Given a set of identifiers, an identifier is called *unique* if it is *different* from every other in the set. Two identifiers are different if they are spelled differently, or if they appear in different [packages](/Packages/) and are not [exported](/Declarations%20and%20scope/exported_identifiers.html). Otherwise, they are the same.
