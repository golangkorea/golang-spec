# [Logical operators](#logical-operators)

Logical operators apply to [boolean](/Types/boolean_types.html) values and yield a result of the same type as the operands. The right operand is evaluated conditionally.

```
&&    conditional AND    p && q  is  "if p then q else false"
||    conditional OR     p || q  is  "if p then true else q"
!     NOT                !p      is  "not p"
```
