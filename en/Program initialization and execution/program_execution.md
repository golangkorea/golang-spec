# [Program execution](#program-execution)

A complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package called the *main package* with all the packages it imports, transitively. The main package must have package name `main` and declare a function `main` that takes no arguments and returns no value.

```go
func main() { â€¦ }
```

Program execution begins by initializing the main package and then invoking the function `main`. When that function invocation returns, the program exits. It does not wait for other (non-`main`) goroutines to complete.
