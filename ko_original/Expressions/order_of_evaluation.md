# Order of evaluation

At package level, [initialization dependencies](/Program%20initialization%20and%20execution/package_initialization.html) determine the evaluation order of individual initialization expressions in [variable declarations](/Declarations%20and%20scope/variable_declarations.html). Otherwise, when evaluating the [operands](/Expressions/operands.html) of an expression, assignment, or [return statement](/Statements/return_statements.html), all function calls, method calls, and communication operations are evaluated in lexical left-to-right order.

For example, in the (function-local) assignment

```
y[f()], ok = g(h(), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()
```

the function calls and communication happen in the order f(), h(), i(), j(), <-c, g(), and k(). However, the order of those events compared to the evaluation and indexing of x and the evaluation of y is not specified.

```
a := 1
f := func() int { a++; return a }
x := []int{a, f()}            // x may be [1, 2] or [2, 2]: evaluation order between a and f() is not specified
m := map[int]int{a: 1, a: 2}  // m may be {2: 1} or {2: 2}: evaluation order between the two map assignments is not specified
n := map[int]int{a: f()}      // n may be {2: 3} or {3: 3}: evaluation order between the key and the value is not specified
```

At package level, initialization dependencies override the left-to-right rule for individual initialization expressions, but not for operands within each expression:

```
var a, b, c = f() + v(), g(), sqr(u()) + v()

func f() int        { return c }
func g() int        { return a }
func sqr(x int) int { return x*x }

// functions u and v are independent of all other variables and functions
```

The function calls happen in the order u(), sqr(), v(), f(), v(), and g().

Floating-point operations within a single expression are evaluated according to the associativity of the operators. Explicit parentheses affect the evaluation by overriding the default associativity. In the expression x + (y + z) the addition y + z is performed before adding x.
