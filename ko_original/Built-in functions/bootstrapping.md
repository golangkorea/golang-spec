# Bootstrapping

Current implementations provide several built-in functions useful during bootstrapping. These functions are documented for completeness but are not guaranteed to stay in the language. They do not return a result.

```
Function   Behavior

print      prints all arguments; formatting of arguments is implementation-specific
println    like print but prints spaces between arguments and a newline at the end
```

Implementation restriction: `print` and `println` need not accept arbitrary argument types, but printing of boolean, numeric, and string [types](/Types) must be supported.
