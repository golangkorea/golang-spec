# Fallthrough statements

A "fallthrough" statement transfers control to the first statement of the next case clause in an [expression "switch" statement](/Statements/switch_statements.html#expression-switches). It may be used only as the final non-empty statement in such a clause.

<pre>
<a id="FallthroughStmt">FallthroughStmt</a> = "fallthrough" .
