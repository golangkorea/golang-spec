# Goto statements

A "goto" statement transfers control to the statement with the corresponding label within the same function.

<pre>
<a id="GotoStmt">GotoStmt</a> = "goto" <a href="/Statements/labeled_statements.html#Label">Label</a> .
</pre>

```
goto Error
```

Executing the "goto" statement must not cause any variables to come into [scope](/Declarations%20and%20scope/) that were not already in scope at the point of the goto. For instance, this example:

```
	goto L  // BAD
	v := 3
L:
```

is erroneous because the jump to label L skips the creation of v.

A "goto" statement outside a [block](/Blocks/) cannot jump to a label inside that block. For instance, this example:

```
if n%2 == 1 {
	goto L1
}
for n > 0 {
	f()
	n--
L1:
	f()
	n--
}
```

is erroneous because the label L1 is inside the "for" statement's block but the goto is not.
