# Break statements

A "break" statement terminates execution of the innermost "[for](/Statements/for_statements.html)", "[switch](/Statements/switch_statements.html)", or "[select](/Statements/select_statements.html)" statement within the same function.

<pre>
<a id="BreakStmt">BreakStmt</a> = "break" [ <a href="/Statements/labeled_statements.html#Label">Label</a> ] .
</pre>

If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for", "switch", or "select" statement, and that is the one whose execution terminates.

```
OuterLoop:
	for i = 0; i < n; i++ {
		for j = 0; j < m; j++ {
			switch a[i][j] {
			case nil:
				state = Error
				break OuterLoop
			case item:
				state = Found
				break OuterLoop
			}
		}
	}
```
